# CoBa Synthesis Engine: Detailed Software Architecture

Here's a more detailed architectural blueprint for CoBa Synthesis Engine, building upon your initial outline:

**1. Core Modules & Components:**

We can visualize CoBa Synthesis Engine as a pipeline with distinct modules, each responsible for a specific stage of the analysis process.

```
[ CLI Input & Project Loader ] --> [ Code Analysis Engine ] --> [ Data Storage & Management ] --> [ Output & Visualization ]
```

Let's break down each module further:

**1.1. CLI Input & Project Loader (Module :one:)**

* **Purpose:**  Handles user interaction via the command line, parses commands, and loads the target codebase into the system.
* **Components:**
    * **Command Line Interface (CLI) Parser:**
        * **Technology:** Python's `argparse` or `click` libraries are excellent for building robust CLIs.
        * **Functionality:**
            * Parses commands like `auto-flow load_language <language>`, `auto-flow load_project <path_to_project>`, and potentially other commands for analysis configurations, output formats, etc.
            * Validates user input and provides helpful error messages.
            * Manages command-line arguments and options.
    * **Project Loader:**
        * **Technology:** Python's `os` and `pathlib` modules for file system interaction.
        * **Functionality:**
            * Takes the project path as input.
            * Recursively scans directories and identifies files.
            * **File Categorization Logic:**
                * **Language Detection:**  Based on user-specified language, file extensions, and potentially shebang lines (for scripts).
                * **File Type Classification:**
                    * **Source Code:**  `.cpp`, `.h`, `.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.go`, etc. (Configurable list).
                    * **Build Code:** `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `package.json` (scripts section), etc. (Configurable).
                    * **Dependency Files:** `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, etc. (Configurable).
                    * **Library Files:**  Detection of external libraries might require dependency analysis and package manager integration. Initially, this might be simpler - categorize files within "node_modules", "venv/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages", etc. as libraries.
                    * **Configuration Files:** `.yaml`, `.json`, `.ini`, `.xml` (Potentially for future feature to analyze configurations).
                    * **Documentation Files:** `.md`, `.rst`, `.txt` (Potentially for future documentation analysis).
                    * **Ignored Files/Directories:**  `.gitignore` support, user-defined exclusion patterns.
            * **Project Metadata:** Collect basic project information like project name (from directory name), programming language, and root directory.

**1.2. Code Analysis Engine (Module :two:)**

* **Purpose:**  The heart of CoBa Synthesis Engine. It performs static analysis to extract meaningful metadata from the codebase.
* **Components:**
    * **Parser Module:**
        * **Technology:**
            * **Option 1 (LSP-based):** Leverage Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients for each supported language (e.g., `pylsp-client` for Python, `node-lsp` for JavaScript, potentially clangd/ccls for C++). LSP provides rich semantic information, code completion, diagnostics, and parsing capabilities.
            * **Option 2 (Tree-sitter):**  A fast and robust parser generator. Tree-sitter parsers are available for many languages and generate concrete syntax trees (CSTs), which can be transformed into ASTs.
            * **Option 3 (Custom Parsers):**  Most complex and time-consuming, but offers maximum control and potentially accuracy for specific analysis needs. Consider using parser generators like ANTLR or writing parsers from scratch if necessary for very specific or niche languages.
        * **Selection Rationale:**  **Start with Tree-sitter.** It's fast, supports many languages, generates AST-like structures (CSTs can be easily transformed), and is relatively easier to integrate than building custom parsers. LSP is powerful but might be heavier to set up initially for basic parsing.  LSP could be considered later for more advanced semantic analysis.
        * **Functionality:**
            * Parses source code files based on detected language.
            * Handles parsing errors gracefully and reports them (potentially with location information).
            * Outputs Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) or similar structured representations.
    * **AST Generator:**
        * **Technology:**  If using Tree-sitter, the CSTs are already close to ASTs.  Libraries like `ast` (Python) can help transform CSTs to more conventional AST representations if needed. For LSP, the LSP server often provides semantic information and AST-like structures.
        * **Functionality:**
            * Transforms the parser output (CST or LSP data) into a standardized AST representation for further analysis.
            * Ensures the AST is suitable for execution flow tracking and dependency analysis.
    * **Execution Flow Tracker:**
        * **Technology:** Graph algorithms, AST traversal, symbolic execution (potentially for future enhancements).
        * **Functionality:**
            * **Function Call Graph Generation:** Traverse ASTs to identify function definitions and function calls. Build a graph where nodes are functions and edges represent calls.
            * **Control Flow Analysis:** Analyze control flow statements (if, else, loops, switch) within functions to understand execution paths.  This might involve basic control flow graph (CFG) construction within functions.
            * **Execution Path Extraction (Simplified):**  For now, focus on tracing function calls.  More complex execution path analysis (considering loops and conditions deeply) can be a future enhancement.
    * **Variable Dependency Graph:**
        * **Technology:** Graph databases (Neo4j), graph algorithms, symbol table management.
        * **Functionality:**
            * **Symbol Table Construction:** During AST traversal, build symbol tables to track variable declarations, scope, and types (if available).
            * **Variable Usage Tracking:** Identify where variables are declared, modified (assigned to), and used (read from).
            * **Dependency Graph Generation:** Create a graph where nodes are variables and edges represent dependencies (e.g., "variable A is used in the expression that assigns to variable B").  This can be valuable for understanding data flow.
    * **Microservice & API Mapper:**
        * **Technology:**  Regular expressions, static analysis of code patterns, potentially network traffic analysis (for runtime analysis in the future).
        * **Functionality:**
            * **HTTP/gRPC Call Detection:**  Scan code for patterns indicating HTTP requests (e.g., using libraries like `requests` in Python, `fetch` in JavaScript, HTTP clients in C++) and gRPC calls (gRPC client libraries).
            * **API Endpoint Extraction (Static):**  Try to statically extract API endpoint URLs from code (may be limited in accuracy due to dynamic URL construction).
            * **Service Dependency Graph (Initial Version):**  Create a basic graph showing services and their potential communication based on detected API calls.  This will likely be a simplified static analysis and may require refinement.

**1.3. Data Storage & Processing (Module :three:)**

* **Purpose:**  Stores the extracted code metadata and relationships in a structured and queryable format.
* **Components:**
    * **Graph Database (Neo4j):**
        * **Technology:** Neo4j is a good choice for graph data. Consider cloud-based Neo4j AuraDB for ease of setup and scalability.
        * **Schema Design:**
            * **Nodes:**
                * `File` (properties: path, language, type)
                * `Function` (properties: name, qualified_name, start_line, end_line)
                * `Variable` (properties: name, scope, type (if available))
                * `Class` (properties: name, qualified_name, start_line, end_line)
                * `Module/Package` (for dependency tracking)
                * `API Endpoint` (properties: URL, method)
                * `Service` (name - inferred from API calls)
            * **Relationships:**
                * `CONTAINS` (File -> Function, File -> Class, File -> Variable)
                * `CALLS` (Function -> Function)
                * `DEFINES` (File -> Function, Class -> Function, etc.)
                * `USES_VARIABLE` (Function -> Variable, Class -> Variable)
                * `MODIFIES_VARIABLE` (Function -> Variable)
                * `DEPENDS_ON` (Module/Package -> Module/Package)
                * `COMMUNICATES_WITH` (Service -> Service via API Endpoint)
        * **Data Ingestion:**  Write Python scripts to process the output from the Code Analysis Engine and populate the Neo4j database with nodes and relationships based on the schema.
    * **Data Processing Layer (Python):**
        * **Technology:** Python for data transformation, querying Neo4j using the Neo4j Python driver.
        * **Functionality:**
            * **Data Transformation:**  Convert analysis results into a format suitable for Neo4j ingestion.
            * **Querying Interface:**  Provide functions or APIs to query Neo4j for specific information (e.g., "find all functions called by function X", "get all dependencies of file Y").
            * **Data Aggregation and Summarization:**  Potentially perform aggregations on the graph data to generate summaries or metrics.

**1.4. Output: Interactive Visualization & Reports (Module :four:)**

* **Purpose:**  Presents the analysis results to the user in a user-friendly and insightful way.
* **Components:**
    * **Graph-based Visualization (Interactive UI):**
        * **Technology:**
            * **Backend (API):** Python (Flask/FastAPI) to serve data from Neo4j to the frontend.  API endpoints for querying graph data and generating visualization data.
            * **Frontend (UI):**
                * **Framework:** React, Vue.js, or Svelte for building a dynamic web UI.
                * **Graph Visualization Library:**
                    * **D3.js:**  Powerful but requires more manual coding.
                    * **Graphviz.js:** For rendering static graphs (might be useful for initial reports).
                    * **React-Force-Graph, Vis.js, Cytoscape.js:** Higher-level graph libraries built on D3.js or other technologies, providing easier graph layout and interaction. **React-Force-Graph is a good option for React.**
                * **Interactive Features:**
                    * Node clicking (to show details about functions, variables, files).
                    * Edge highlighting (to emphasize relationships).
                    * Zooming and panning.
                    * Filtering and search (e.g., filter functions by name, files by type).
                    * Layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical, etc.).
        * **Functionality:**
            * Display interactive graph visualizations of function call graphs, dependency graphs, etc.
            * Allow users to explore the codebase visually and understand relationships.
            * Implement "Live Debugging Mode": When a user clicks on a function node, highlight all places where it's called and where it calls other functions, effectively tracing its usage in the codebase.
    * **JSON Reports:**
        * **Technology:** Python for generating JSON, potentially using libraries like `json`.
        * **Functionality:**
            * Generate JSON reports summarizing:
                * Execution flow (function call paths, potential bottlenecks - initially basic, could be more sophisticated later).
                * Dependencies (function dependencies, variable dependencies, module/package dependencies).
                * API communication details (services, endpoints, communication patterns).
            * Reports should be structured and machine-readable for potential integration with other tools or further automated analysis.
    * **Report Generation & Export:**
        * **Technology:** Python, report generation libraries (e.g., `ReportLab` for PDF, `openpyxl` for Excel if needed).
        * **Functionality:**
            * Allow users to generate reports in different formats (JSON, potentially PDF, HTML).
            * Include summaries, visualizations (static graph images), and detailed data in reports.

**2. Technology Stack Summary:**

* **Programming Language:** Python (primary language for backend, CLI, analysis, data processing). JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend UI.

**3. Development Workflow & Next Steps (Based on your suggestions):**

Considering your "Next Steps," starting with **option :one: A basic prototype that parses a sample C++/Python project and extracts function calls** is a very sensible first step.  Let's refine the development plan:

**Phase 1: Core Analysis Prototype (Focus: Function Call Extraction)**

* **Task 1: CLI Setup:**
    * Implement basic CLI using `argparse` or `click` to handle `load_language` and `load_project` commands.
    * Implement basic project loading (file scanning and categorization - focus on source code files initially).
* **Task 2: Parser Integration (Python & C++ - Minimal):**
    * Integrate Tree-sitter parsers for Python and C++.
    * Write code to parse Python and C++ source files using Tree-sitter.
    * Output the CSTs (or transform to basic ASTs).
* **Task 3: Function Call Extraction Logic:**
    * Traverse the CST/AST to identify function definitions and function calls.
    * Extract function names and call relationships.
    * Store function call relationships in memory (e.g., Python dictionaries or lists).
* **Task 4: Simple Output (Text/JSON):**
    * Output the extracted function call information in a simple text format or JSON. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "project": "sample_project",
      "language": "python",
      "function_calls": [
        {"caller": "functionA", "callee": "functionB", "file": "file1.py"},
        {"caller": "functionC", "callee": "functionD", "file": "file2.py"}
      ]
    }
    ```
* **Task 5: Basic Testing:**
    * Create sample Python and C++ projects for testing.
    * Write unit tests to verify the correctness of parsing and function call extraction.

**Phase 2: Data Storage & Visualization (Neo4j & Basic UI)**

* **Task 6: Neo4j Integration (Option :two: - Setting up Neo4j):**
    * Set up Neo4j (local or cloud-based).
    * Design the Neo4j schema (as outlined earlier - start with a simplified schema).
    * Write Python code to ingest the function call data (from Phase 1) into Neo4j.
* **Task 7: Backend API (Flask/FastAPI - Basic):**
    * Create a basic Flask or FastAPI backend with an endpoint to query function call data from Neo4j.
    * The endpoint should return data in a format suitable for visualization.
* **Task 8: Frontend UI (Basic Graph Visualization):**
    * Set up a basic React (or Vue.js) frontend.
    * Integrate a graph visualization library (like React-Force-Graph).
    * Connect the frontend to the backend API to fetch function call data.
    * Display a basic interactive graph visualization of the function call graph.

**Phase 3: Expanding Analysis & Features**

* **Task 9: Variable Dependency Analysis:** Implement Variable Dependency Graph extraction and storage in Neo4j.
* **Task 10: Microservice/API Mapping (Basic):** Implement basic API call detection and service mapping.
* **Task 11: Enhanced Visualization:** Improve the UI with more interactive features, filtering, search, layouts, "Live Debugging Mode" for function tracing.
* **Task 12: Report Generation (JSON & Basic Reports):** Implement JSON report generation and basic report formats.
* **Task 13: Language Support Expansion:** Add support for more languages (JavaScript, Java, Go, etc.).
* **... (Further phases for advanced features, performance optimization, etc.)**

**Starting Point Recommendation:**

Yes, starting with **option :one: A basic prototype that parses a sample C++/Python project and extracts function calls** is the most practical and focused first step. This allows you to validate the core parsing and analysis logic before adding complexity with data storage, visualization, and other features.  Focus on getting a working prototype for function call extraction first, and then incrementally build upon it.

Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific aspect of the architecture or start planning out the implementation of Phase 1!
